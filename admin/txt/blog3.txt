Coffee shop business is not a bad idea and this market is really becoming a delicious piece of cake for investors. The market is attractive, but to survive and develop is not an easy story.
There are many problems encountered in the business process, one of which is the problem of bad odors in the restaurant space. Uncle Dat, currently the owner of a coffee shop near Aeon mall Long Bien, his shop is having problems with the smell of cigarette smoke in the shop space. To solve the problem of the smell of smoke, Uncle Dat used many different ways of deodorizing such as: using orange peels, tangerines, using aromatic oils, cleaning tables and chairs every day, ... Through a lot of efforts , the smell of smoke is still there, making the space of the shop become stuffy and this greatly affects the business activities of the shop for a long time.
Uncle Dat thought of "banning smoking" in the shop, but because he was afraid of losing customers, he only stopped at a reminder, mostly still relying on the consciousness of each customer.
Through the introduction of a friend, Uncle Dat knew about the VTL03 deodorizing air purifier provided by HSVN Global, so he decided to contact us for more advice on this machine. HSVN has clearly explained to me: for deodorizing in coffee shops, HSVN has many lines of ozone air purifiers for you to choose from such as ozone clean C deodorizers, Dr.Air deodorizers.. ., but with the requirement of using an air purifier, deodorizing all day and requiring a product with a modern design to place in the shop, the VTL03 machine is a perfect fit. The area of ​​the shop is not too big, so Uncle Dat only needs to use 1 air purifier.
The VTL03 air purifier and deodorizer product was delivered to the cafe that same day, the images of the VTL03 machine at the cafe were recorded by our staff.
